# Notes

The project requires two components:

1. The Robo sim communicates with ROS. So we either need to do create a Mavlink to ROS bridge (ros-mavlink might help with this) or communicate with the Sim directly using Mavlink.
2. 3D environment. I think Nick will provide some sort of file and then it would be loaded in Unity? If it's that simple that would be awesome but I'm skeptical.
